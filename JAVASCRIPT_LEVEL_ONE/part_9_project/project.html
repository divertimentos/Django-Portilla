            <h1>Welcome do Part 9: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>

            <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to
                normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a
                series of questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all questions
                are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the Spy to read.</p>

            <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
                <li>The spy is between the age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
                <li>The spy is at least 170cm tall</li>
                <li>The spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-ended, but if you feel like you need more
                guidance, check out the solution walkthrough videos! But believe it or not, we've actually covered
                everything you need to know to complete this task. <strong>I would suggest you use JavaScript to prompt
                    the user for information and set these to variables.</strong>Then use these variables to check for
                the four conditions to all be true. It's up to you what the secret message is.</p>

            <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jose Johnson</li>
                <li>26 years old</li>
                <li>175cm tall</li>
                <li>Pet name if "Sammy"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want, you can even separate asking
                for first name and then another prompt for last name.</p>
            <p>Also remember to switch out the script src to your own ".js" file! Right now it's connected to Part9.js which contains the solutions. </p>
